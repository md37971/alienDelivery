# Alien Delivery (Python)
Alien Delivery is a simple game that I developed as a fun personal project in Summer 2024 using the Pygame library in python. In this game, you are an alien working at a mail company and your goal is to deliver the package to the customer before it arrives late; however, it's not an easy journey as there are obstacles in the sky, but you thankfully have your ship to fly. Deliver the package on-time or else....

# How to setup
  1.)  Ensure that Python is installed on your computer through the Python website. <br>
  2.)  Once Python is installed, type the following command line in the command prompt `pip install pygame` to install the pygame library. <br>
  3.)  Download the files/clone the repository. <br>
  4.)  Run the `mainPygame.py` file to launch the game. <br>
  5.)  Have fun! <br>

# Controls
W or UP ARROW KEY - Up <br>
S or DOWN ARROW KEY - Down <br>
A or LEFT ARROW KEY - Left <br>
D or RIGHT ARROW KEY - Right <br>

# Issues
Currently, there are issues with collisions in some of the blocks, resulting in the player teleporting in different directions. I will try to find a solution to this problem.

# Project Inspiration
This project was inspired after I learned the pygame library for the first time in my programming class during my senior year of high school. After my freshman year of college, I wanted to go further on the basics of what I'm able to build in pygame after learning the fundamentals of programming, which inspired me to create this pygame project. 

# Development
Most of the games code is stored in one python file, named mainPygame.py; however, the other .py files are non-core element class files to the game. This project was made before I learned Object-Orientated Programming and as practice, some non-core class files were separate from mainPygame.py. The game's art was made by me using paint.net. The background music was also made by me written in python from a website called EarSketch, where you can create your own song by programming. The game uses a trimmed version of the soundtrack, but the full music code is inside the audio folder. The game's sound effects are not made by me.
